# Gym Application

This is a gym application designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for gym instructors, members, and administrators to manage their gym activities.
For now, the repository only has the landing page HTML.
Work in progress...

## Week 01

During the first week, we worked on the design of the gym application. The application includes different menus for gym instructors, members, and administrators. The main features of the application include:

- A reservation system for gym classes
- A membership system for members to manage their subscription plans
- A dashboard for gym instructors to manage their classes and schedules
- An admin panel for gym admins to manage gym memberships and activities

## Week 02

During the second week, we worked on the HTML structure of the landing page for the gym application. The landing page is designed to showcase the main features of the application. The HTML structure includes:

- A header section featuring the gym logo and a button for users to register or log in to their accounts
- A sidebar with a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections of the landing page
- A features section that displays images and descriptions of the main features of the application, including activities, memberships, and a contact form for inquiries
- A footer section with links to the gym's social media profiles and contact information for further support.

## Week 03
During this week, the following tasks were completed:

- Made corrections on the HTML file to improve its structure and readability.
- Started working on the CSS for the landing page. Pure CSS was used without any tools such as flex or grid.
- Implemented a non-fixed navigation menu in the sidebar to allow users to access it at all times.

These tasks were completed successfully
