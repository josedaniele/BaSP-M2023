# Gym Application

This is a gym application designed to provide an easy-to-use platform for gym instructors, members, and administrators to manage their gym activities.
For now, the repository only has the landing page HTML.
Work in progress...

## Week 01 Figma App

During the first week, we worked on the design of the gym application. The application includes different menus for gym instructors, members, and administrators. The main features of the application include:

- A reservation system for gym classes
- A membership system for members to manage their subscription plans
- A dashboard for gym instructors to manage their classes and schedules
- An admin panel for gym admins to manage gym memberships and activities

## Week 02 HTML

During the second week, we worked on the HTML structure of the landing page for the gym application. The landing page is designed to showcase the main features of the application. The HTML structure includes:

- A header section featuring the gym logo and a button for users to register or log in to their accounts
- A sidebar with a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections of the landing page
- A features section that displays images and descriptions of the main features of the application, including activities, memberships, and a contact form for inquiries
- A footer section with links to the gym's social media profiles and contact information for further support.

## Week 03 Pure CSS 

During this week, the following tasks were completed:

- Made corrections on the HTML file to improve its structure and readability.
- Started working on the CSS for the landing page. Pure CSS was used without any tools such as flex or grid.
- Implemented a non-fixed navigation menu in the sidebar to allow users to access it at all times.

These tasks were completed successfully

## Week 04 CSS & FlexBox

During the fourth week, the responsive design was applied to the page.
The objective was developed as follows:

- The designed versions are mobile with a minimum screen width of 390px up to 600px, then tablet up to 1024px, and then the desktop version.
- Flexbox and media queries were used to achieve the objective.
- The fixed function of the navbar was removed.
- HTML tag corrections were made.

## Week 05 - JavaScript Exercises and CSS Corrections

In this week, we worked with JavaScript exercises aimed at understanding programming logic using variables, operators, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops, and functions in ECMA 5. Additionally, we made corrections to the CSS code from the previous week.

### JavaScript Exercises

The exercises in this week's session focused on practicing JavaScript fundamentals. We began with variable declarations, data types, and operators. Then, we moved on to working with strings and arrays, as well as conditional statements and bucles for. We also creating and using functions.

Through these exercises, we were able to gain a better understanding of how JavaScript works and problems resolution.

### CSS Corrections

In the CSS corrections, we simply removed unnecessary white spaces from the file in order to optimize the code and improve its readability

## Week 06 Log-in and Sign-up Forms

During week 6 of the project, we focused on designing and developing the log-in and sign-up forms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, we used ES5 to validate the various input fields throughout the forms.

If any of the input fields are filled out incorrectly, a span alert message is displayed on the screen with specific error messages. Once the user corrects their input, they can attempt to log in or sign up again.

Once the user enters their information and clicks the log-in or sign-up button, the script checks if all the required fields are filled in correctly. If the information is valid, the user's data is displayed on the screen

## Week 07 Log-in & Sign-up Fetch and Local Storage
This week, we worked on implementing the fetch API on the login.js and sign-up.js pages using the GET method to validate user login and registration data. We also added functionality to save user data to the local storage on successful registration.

The fetch API allows us to make network requests to the server and receive responses asynchronously. We used it to send user input data to the server and receive a response indicating whether the input data was valid or not.

By implementing this functionality, we can improve the user experience by providing immediate feedback to the user if there are any errors in their input data.

To validate the user input, we used the GET method to send the user data to the server and receive a response containing the validation status.

In addition, we implemented local storage functionality on the sign-up page. This feature allowed us to save user data to the local storage on successful registration, so that the next time the user logs in, their data will be auto-filled.

Overall, this week's work was focused on implementing validation for user input using the fetch API and GET method, as well as implementing local storage functionality for the sign-up page.
