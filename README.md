Work in progress...

## Week 01 Figma App

During the first week, we worked on the design of the gym application. The application includes different menus for gym instructors, members, and administrators. The main features of the application include:

- A reservation system for gym classes
- A membership system for members to manage their subscription plans
- A dashboard for gym instructors to manage their classes and schedules
- An admin panel for gym admins to manage gym memberships and activities

## Week 02 HTML

During the second week, we worked on the HTML structure of the landing page for the gym application. The landing page is designed to showcase the main features of the application. The HTML structure includes:

- A header section featuring the gym logo and a button for users to register or log in to their accounts
- A sidebar with a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate through the different sections of the landing page
- A features section that displays images and descriptions of the main features of the application, including activities, memberships, and a contact form for inquiries
- A footer section with links to the gym's social media profiles and contact information for further support.

## Week 03 Pure CSS 

During this week, the following tasks were completed:

- Made corrections on the HTML file to improve its structure and readability.
- Started working on the CSS for the landing page. Pure CSS was used without any tools such as flex or grid.
- Implemented a non-fixed navigation menu in the sidebar to allow users to access it at all times.

These tasks were completed successfully

## Week 04 CSS & FlexBox

During the fourth week, the responsive design was applied to the page.
The objective was developed as follows:

- The designed versions are mobile with a minimum screen width of 390px up to 600px, then tablet up to 1024px, and then the desktop version.
- Flexbox and media queries were used to achieve the objective.
- The fixed function of the navbar was removed.
- HTML tag corrections were made.

## Week 05 - JavaScript Exercises and CSS Corrections

In this week, we worked with JavaScript exercises aimed at understanding programming logic using variables, operators, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops, and functions in ECMA 5. Additionally, we made corrections to the CSS code from the previous week.

### JavaScript Exercises

The exercises in this week's session focused on practicing JavaScript fundamentals. We began with variable declarations, data types, and operators. Then, we moved on to working with strings and arrays, as well as conditional statements and bucles for. We also creating and using functions.

Through these exercises, we were able to gain a better understanding of how JavaScript works and problems resolution.
